Problem 5: Product of Array Except Self (LeetCode #238)
https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that answer[i]
is the product of all elements except nums[i].

You must solve it WITHOUT using division and in O(n) time.

Example:
    Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
