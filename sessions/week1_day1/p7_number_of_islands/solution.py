https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and formed by connecting adjacent lands
horizontally or vertically.

Example:
    Input: grid = [
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","1","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","1","1"]
    ]
    Output: 3
