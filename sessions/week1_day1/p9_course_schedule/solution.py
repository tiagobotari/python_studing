Problem 9: Course Schedule (LeetCode #207)
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

There are numCourses courses (0 to numCourses-1). You are given prerequisite
pairs where [a, b] means you must take course b before course a.
Return True if you can finish all courses (i.e., no circular dependency).

Example:
    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
    Output: True   # Take course 0, then course 1

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: False  # Circular dependency
